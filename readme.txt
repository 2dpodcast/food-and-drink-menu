* Unlimited menus and menu items
* Add a photo and price for each menu item
* Menu sections can include guidance, such as "All entrees come with a side salad or fries"
* Display your menu with a simple shortcode
* Use the widget to display your menu in a sidebar
* Responsive menu layout to improve mobile viewing
